What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- two pointers solution
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- two pointers solution
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
- first solution using frequency array is better because we can't get all arrays to memory
- so it's better to use freq array then get part of nums2 two memory instead of nums1
